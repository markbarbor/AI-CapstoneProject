# Model Card: Black Box Function Approximation

## Model Description

**Input:**

The model accepts input vectors representing various features used to approximate the black box functions. The inputs are normalized numerical arrays derived from synthetic data.

**Output:**

The model outputs predicted numerical values corresponding to the unknown functions' outputs. These predictions aim to closely match the actual outputs of the black box functions.

**Model Architecture:**

**Model Type:** Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)
**Noise Parameter:** Included to handle data variability and improve generalization

## Performance

**Performance Metrics:**

**Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Used to measure the accuracy of the modelâ€™s predictions against the actual outputs.
Cross-Validation Score: Ensures robust performance estimates and avoids overfitting.

**Dataset:**
Synthetic data provided by the course instructors, split into training and validation sets to evaluate model performance.

## Limitations

**Synthetic Nature:** The dataset consists of synthetic data, which may not fully represent real-world scenarios. Thus, the model's applicability to real-world data might be limited.
Scalability: Gaussian Process Regression may face scalability issues with very large datasets due to its computational complexity.

## Trade-offs

**Model Complexity vs. Interpretability:** While GPR provides uncertainty measurements and is highly interpretable, it may not be as scalable or efficient as more complex models like deep neural networks.
Overfitting Risk: Initial attempts showed a tendency to overfit the data, which was mitigated by adding noise parameters and using cross-validation.
