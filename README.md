#Black Box Function Approximation Competition

##Non-Technical Explanation of Your Project

This project was part of a capstone competition aimed at approximating black box functions using various machine learning techniques. The primary goal was to develop a model that could predict unknown functions based on provided input-output pairs. This involved iterating on model selection, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning to achieve the best possible performance.

##Data

The data used in this project consisted of input-output pairs for several unknown functions. Each function's dataset was provided in separate files, containing initial inputs and corresponding outputs. These datasets were the basis for training and validating the models. The data was obtained from the course materials provided during the competition.

##Model

The primary model used for this project was the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model, chosen for its effectiveness in handling small datasets and providing uncertainty measurements. 

##Results

The iterative improvements made to the modelled to a consistent improvement in performance. The final model achieved significant accuracy in predicting the black box functions. Key learnings included the importance of thorough exploratory data analysis, systematic feature engineering, and robust validation techniques.
