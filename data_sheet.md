# Datasheet for Black Box Function Approximation Dataset

## Motivation

Purpose: The dataset was created to facilitate a capstone competition aimed at approximating black box functions using machine learning techniques.
Creators: The dataset was created by the course instructors and organizers from Imperial College London as part of their Professional Certificate for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence program.
Funding: The creation of the dataset was funded by the educational program provided by Imperial College London.

## Composition

Instances Represented: The dataset comprises input-output pairs for several unknown functions.
Number of Instances: Each function's dataset contains a varying number of instances, typically ranging from 100 to 1000 input-output pairs.
Missing Data: There is no missing data in the provided datasets.
Confidential Data: The dataset does not contain any data that might be considered confidential. All data points are synthetic and generated for the purpose of the competition.

## Collection Process

Data Acquisition: The data was synthetically generated by the course instructors using predefined unknown functions.
Sampling Strategy: Since the data is synthetically generated, there is no sampling strategy involved.
Time Frame: The data was generated specifically for the capstone competition and provided to participants at the beginning of the competition period.

## Preprocessing/Cleaning/Labeling

Preprocessing: Basic preprocessing steps included normalization of input features and conversion of data to numpy arrays for compatibility with machine learning models.
Raw Data: The raw synthetic data was saved and provided to participants without any additional preprocessing beyond the initial generation.

## Uses

Other Tasks: The dataset can be used for various machine learning tasks such as regression analysis, function approximation, and model validation.
Impact on Future Uses: The synthetic nature of the data ensures no ethical or legal concerns. However, it is important for users to understand that the data does not represent real-world scenarios and should be used primarily for educational purposes.
Unsuitable Uses: The dataset should not be used for applications requiring real-world data accuracy, such as medical diagnostics or financial forecasting.

## Distribution

Distribution: The dataset has been distributed to participants of the capstone competition as part of the course materials.
Intellectual Property: The dataset is subject to the terms of use as specified by Imperial College London and is intended for educational purposes only.

## Maintenance

Maintenance: The dataset is maintained by the course instructors and organizers at Imperial College London. Any updates or changes to the dataset will be communicated to participants through official channels.
